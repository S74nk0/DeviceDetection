# DeviceDetection
Small project for identifying CPU(s) features and AMD and NVIDIA GPUs. For now 3 small executables that print out devices information in JSON format.

## TODO:
  - ADD LICENSE (REFERENCE 3rdparty as well)
  - separate executables into libraries (easier to embed into other languages FFI)
  - Make it compile under Linux
  - dynamic library loading
